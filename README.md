# Advent of Code 2023

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the 2023 Advent of Code (AoC) using the Go programming language.
the AoC is an annual event where participants are given a new coding challenge each day for the month of December. The challenges are designed to be fun and engaging while also being a great way to learn a new programming language or sharpen your skills in a language you already know. it can be found at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Structure

The repository is structured in a way that each day of the AoC has its own folder. Within each day's folder, there are two more folders for each of the two challenges of the day. Each challenge folder contains an input text file and a main Go file.

Here is a brief overview of the structure:

```
day1
│
├── challenge1
│   ├── input.txt
│   └── main.go
│
└── challenge2
    ├── input.txt
    └── main.go
```

This structure is repeated for each day of the AoC.

## Usage

To run the code for a specific day's challenge, navigate to the corresponding day's folder and run the `main.go` file. The `input.txt` file contains the input data for the challenge.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, any and all contributions are welcome. If you see an area for improvement or a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
